# Notes / Experiences

## General

- I haven't even looked at Node.js before, so learning it took like a day or so
- I think I would've used Python Flask instead or maybe Kotlin, I don't like the way that ReactJS acts with ExpressJS,
  makes it unnecessarily difficult in my opinion
- SQLite is also a tough place, I looked at MongoDB and Redis, but I think they are a bit too large for this need, but
  would be easy to switch to if needed
- I also only used Bootstrap for the front-end, since I don't really see a need to make a custom solution for 2 divs

## ReactJS

- I've only used React Native for Android, but I can clearly see that it was derived from this
- I feel like ReactJS is really restrictive when used "bare"
  - I didn't use the create-react-app package, I just used the CDN version
  - I would've used Next.js for this instead, but this was just a React task to do

## NodeJS

- First time using JavaScript as the back-end to an app, but I found it pretty good to use
- ExpressJS is a good choice for this, it's a nice framework with a variety of plugins to help with the routing and
  handling of requests
